The HARD TALK series courageously exposes what many dare not utter, challenging revered Sufi masters with profoundly provocative accusations. Here, spirituality is tested against harsh truths, truths that question the intentions behind practices, confront the comfort zones of mystics, and expose contradictions in faith and action. Each session peels away superficial layers, inviting intense self-reflection and honesty, shattering illusions and igniting authentic transformation.</p><p>Are you prepared to face the raw, unapologetic conversations that redefine spiritual integrity? Step forward into HARD TALK, where answers aren't comfortable, but they're undeniably necessary.</p>"
